## [Unreleased]

_Nothing yet. Post-0.5.1 changes will be listed here as normal Keep-a-Changelog deltas
(Added / Changed / Fixed / Removed)._

## [0.5.1] - 2026-07-03

**Dogfood & hardening patch — no new product surface.** Mirrors the v0.3→v0.3.1 precedent: a
checklist-driven pass finding and fixing rough edges in the v0.5.0 Workbench MVP, not adding
capability. No executor/panel behavior changes beyond what's listed here, no command allowlist
growth, no v0.6 work.

### Verified

- **Clean-clone / Windows dogfood** (PR #86) — fresh `git clone` → `uv sync` → version/doctor/
  status/presets → full test suite → lint/decisions/context/MCP checks, plus an HTTP-level
  Workbench panel smoke, all matching the dev checkout.
- **Workbench interactive smoke** (PR #87) — a clean scratch-directory first run (empty state,
  demo, approve, token-gating) matched expectations end-to-end.
- **Manual execution dogfood** (PR #89) — the real guarded-executor path, previously untested
  through the panel: a manually-seeded `write_file` action and a manually-seeded `run_command`
  action both executed successfully through the panel's real HTTP API in a temp/safe project;
  both a non-allowlisted command and a missing payload artifact failed closed; a crafted request
  body (different target/content/command/argv/env/cwd/timeout) had **zero effect** on what
  actually ran.

### Fixed

- **Workbench localhost bind/shutdown hardening** (PR #88) — `make_server()` now re-checks the
  actual bound address after `bind()` (defense-in-depth; no confirmed `0.0.0.0`-bind bug was ever
  found), and a new regression test locks in that `server_close()` actually closes the socket on
  `Ctrl+C`/`KeyboardInterrupt`.
- **`ExecutionResult.dry_run` metadata bug** (PR #89) — every real (non-preview) execution
  response incorrectly reported `dry_run: true` alongside `executed: true`; now correctly `false`.
  Display/metadata only — did not change what the executor was willing to run.
- **Misleading `run_command` panel message** (PR #89) — a completed or blocked command action's
  card could falsely claim "does not resolve to an allowlisted argv" even when it had already run
  successfully; the card now shows the actual target/status instead.
- **`uv.lock` self-version drift** (PR #90) — the local `vibe-council` package entry in `uv.lock`
  had read a stale `0.2.0` since before `v0.3.0`, causing an accidental lockfile diff on every
  `uv sync`/`uv run`. Synced to match `pyproject.toml`/`backend/__init__.py`; no dependency package
  versions changed.

### Unchanged (security posture)

Nothing here relaxes or expands the v0.5.0 security model:

- Approval is still **separate from execution** — approving never auto-executes.
- The panel is still **localhost-only (`127.0.0.1`)** and **POSTs are still token-gated**.
- Payload artifacts are still **local, gitignored, write-once, and hash-verified**.
- Command execution is still **fixed argv + `shell=False`, always** — no dynamic arguments, no
  arbitrary shell, no new allowlist entries.

### Explicit non-goals (deferred, not started)

No v0.6 agent-to-Workbench bridge · no personalization/profile implementation · no mobile/LAN/
voice access · no hosted/team/cloud work · no command allowlist expansion.

### Verification

- 576 tests pass; redaction lint 0 critical; decisions lint passes; `context check` 21/21; MCP
  health 21/21.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-02

**AI Council Workbench MVP (guarded execution).** A task now moves through **visible stages**, an AI
proposes a change, an **audited approval** step gates it (deterministic guards are the boundary; the
Approval Auditor is advisory only), and — as a **separate, explicit** step — an approved,
narrowly-bounded action can actually run: a file write/edit behind a verified local payload artifact,
or an exact allowlisted command behind a fixed-argv resolver. Still local-first and stdlib-only: no
new runtime dependency, no provider/model/network call from the executor, no LAN/mobile/remote
surface.

### Added

- **Runtime store + state machine** (`backend/workbench_runtime.py`, `backend/workbench_orchestrator.py`)
  — a gitignored `.council/runtime/` JSON tree (`Task`/`Stage`/`ApprovalRequest`/`ApprovalDecision`/
  `Action`/`AuditResult`) and a deterministic task lifecycle (plan → request approval →
  approve/reject/hold → executing → complete/fail/hold).
- **Deterministic trust boundary** (`backend/workbench_trust.py`) — path allow/deny, command
  allowlist, secret patterns, change-size limits, cloud-egress consent; re-run at execution time, not
  just at approval time.
- **Advisory Approval Auditor** (`backend/workbench_auditor.py`) — a human-readable approval summary
  that copies risk/blocked/findings verbatim from the trust boundary, so it can never relax a block.
- **Localhost Workbench panel** (`backend/workbench_panel.py`, `vibe workbench serve`) — task/approval
  cards, approve/reject/hold, a "Create demo task" dogfood button, and (new this release) a separate,
  explicit **"Execute"** step for approved actions.
- **Payload artifacts + hash/scope verification** (`backend/workbench_payloads.py`) — bounded file
  actions carry content in a local, gitignored, write-once `.council/runtime/payloads/<action_id>.json`,
  hashed at creation and re-verified before every real execution.
- **Bounded file write/edit execution** (`backend/workbench_executor.py`) — atomic writes, size/
  line-delta limits, path/symlink guard, explicit-overwrite requirement, no content in logs.
- **Command allowlist → fixed argv resolver** (`backend/workbench_commands.py`) — no shell, no string
  parsing, `sys.executable`-based, no OS-specific launcher dependency; plus a dry-run preview.
- **Real exact allowlisted command execution** — `subprocess.run(shell=False)` with a sanitized
  environment, project-root cwd, a timeout, and bounded/redaction-checked output capture.
- **Panel execute + result display** for both bounded file actions and allowlisted commands — the
  browser only ever sends an action id.
- **v0.5 release readiness / dogfood checklist** (`docs/plans/v0.5-release-readiness.md`) and prepared
  release notes (`docs/releases/v0.5.0.md`).

### Changed

- `workbench_trust`'s command allowlist gained `vibe context build` (a gap noted while building the
  command resolver).
- README / project status / agent brief reflect the completed guarded-executor track.

### Safety

- **Approval is separate from execution** — approving only records a decision; it never writes a
  file, edits a file, or runs a command.
- **The deterministic trust boundary re-runs at execution time** — a stored/stale `AuditResult` or a
  cached preview cannot authorize anything; the advisory Auditor is never the gate.
- **The browser sends only an action id** (+ a startup token) — never file content, patch text, a
  command string, argv, cwd, env, or a timeout; the executor resolves everything server-side.
- **Payload artifacts are local/gitignored**, write-once, and hash/scope-verified before use.
- **Command execution is fixed argv + `shell=False`, always** — no dynamic arguments, ever.
- **The subprocess environment is allowlist-built** (no inherited secrets/API keys/`.env`); a timeout
  and output-byte cap are enforced; a critical redaction finding in output blocks the result instead
  of storing it.
- **The panel is localhost-only (`127.0.0.1`) and token-gated** — no CORS wildcard.
- Redaction lint remains **0 critical**; `context check` and MCP health remain **21/21**.
- **License/provenance remains an unresolved commercial "Question 0"** — no clearance claim, no
  `LICENSE`.

### Verification

- 570 tests pass; redaction lint 0 critical; decisions lint passes; `context check` 21/21; MCP health
  21/21.

### Deferred

- Arbitrary command execution · a larger command allowlist · package install/deploy/`git push` ·
  provider/model/API calls from the executor · LAN/mobile/remote access · voice · background/
  autonomous loops · a plugin system · multi-user/team/hosted mode · cloud sync.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-01

**Read-only MCP / Claude Code workflow.** Exposes vibe-council's curated project memory — project
status, curated decisions, and the generated context pack + health — to Claude Code / local MCP
clients over a **read-only** stdio server, without granting any write/action authority. Still
deterministic and local-first: no `mcp` SDK dependency (the transport is a minimal stdlib
JSON-RPC-over-stdio server), no write-capable tools, no provider/model calls, no hosted/sync.

### Added

- **`vibe mcp contract`** — prints the read-only MCP contract: read-only resources/tools and the
  explicit forbidden mutation/action tools (`backend/mcp_contract.py`).
- **`vibe mcp inspect`** — a dependency-free read-only smoke over the read layer (status + curated
  decisions; `--context`/`--health` also build the context pack + health **in memory**, writing no
  `.council/` files; `--id`, `--json`).
- **`vibe mcp serve --stdio`** — a read-only MCP **stdio transport** (newline-delimited JSON-RPC
  2.0: `initialize`/`tools/list`/`tools/call`/`resources/list`/`resources/read`/`ping`) wrapping the
  read layer (`backend/mcp_stdio.py`). No `mcp` SDK, no HTTP/socket/daemon.
- **MCP read layer** (`backend/mcp_server.py`): tools `get_project_status`, `list_decisions`,
  `show_decision` (path-guarded to `docs/decisions/`), `get_context_pack`, `check_context_health`;
  resources `vibe://status`, `vibe://decisions`, `vibe://decisions/{id}`, `vibe://context/latest`.
- **Claude Code / MCP setup docs** (`docs/mcp/claude-code-setup.md`, a generic MCP stdio client
  pattern) and **v0.4 MCP dogfood notes** (`docs/dogfood/v0.4-mcp-local-dogfood.md`).
- **Tests** for the MCP contract, read layer, stdio transport, and the no-write/path/forbidden-tool
  boundaries.

### Changed

- **Context-pack budget protects core sections.** Under budget pressure the builder now **compacts**
  core sections instead of dropping them — the decision index and the rejected-alternatives index
  survive (compacted), and full decision bodies are trimmed **first**. This fixes the recurring
  14000-char cliff that previously dropped the required `section:decision-index`.
- **README** documents the read-only MCP workflow and commands.
- **Project status / agent brief** reflect the read-only MCP release.

### Safety

- MCP exposes **read-only** status, decisions, context pack, and context health **only**.
- **No** write/git/shell/provider/model tools; **no** decision promotion through MCP; `git_status` is
  forbidden for v0.4.
- **No raw `.council/` exposure** and **no private/untracked plans** exposed; `show_decision` is
  path-traversal guarded to `docs/decisions/`.
- **MCP context reads do not write `.council/`** (built in memory); the forbidden `write_file` tool
  is tested to return a JSON-RPC error.
- Redaction lint remains **0 critical**; `context check` remains **21/21**.
- **License/provenance remains an unresolved commercial "Question 0"** — no clearance claim, no
  `LICENSE`.

### Verification

- 287 tests pass; redaction lint 0 critical; decisions lint passes; `context check` 21/21; MCP
  contract/inspect/serve-help pass; bounded MCP stdio smoke passes; no-write and privacy audits clean.

### Deferred

- MCP SDK / full protocol compliance · write-capable MCP tools · remote approval transport ·
  hosted/team/sync · dashboard / mobile / custom transport · standalone
  `vibe://rejected-alternatives` / `vibe://release-notes` / `vibe://constraints` resources ·
  token-aware budget · vector/hybrid retrieval · LLM-based context eval · rolling summaries ·
  operator notifications / event log.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-30

**Dogfood hardening for the v0.3 decision-memory / context loop.** No new command surface — this
release uses the v0.3 loop on real work and fixes the rough edges that surfaced. Still
deterministic and local-first: no MCP, no rolling summaries, no token-aware tokenizer, no vector
retrieval, no LLM eval, no dashboard/hosted layer. Raw `.council/` outputs and generated packs/
exports/operator status stay gitignored; `docs/decisions/*.md` remain the curated source of truth.

### Added

- **v0.3.1 dogfood notes** (`docs/dogfood/v0.3.1-notes.md`) — public-safe findings from exercising
  the full v0.3 loop on real work.
- **Tests** for the decision-CLI rough edges and the CLI UX output (`tests/test_cli_ux.py`), plus a
  real-repo `context check` guard that builds from the actual `docs/decisions/` + `STATUS.md` and
  asserts a perfect, redaction-clean score.

### Fixed

- **`decisions promote` rejects placeholder-only drafts** — an all-`TODO` scaffold can no longer be
  promoted; core sections (Decision, Rationale, and Consequences/Next actions) must carry meaningful
  content. Scoped to `promote` (not `decisions lint`).
- **`decisions promote` follows the curated `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md` filename convention** (date from
  frontmatter, slug from title → id → stem; no more `DEC-….md`).
- **`decisions new --from-run` maps obvious review sections** into the draft (verdict → Decision,
  rationale → Rationale, alternatives/rejected → Alternatives considered, risks/consequences →
  Consequences, next actions → Next actions); unmatched sections keep `TODO` markers.
- **Long extracted slugs are capped/sanitized.**
- **Context packs include an explicit human-review promotion boundary**, so `vibe context check`
  passes **21/21** on the real repo (the missed advisory was `memory:human-review`).
- **Context-pack default char budget bumped 12000 → 14000** so the curated set keeps its core
  signals (the trimmer was dropping the rejected-alternatives index).

### Changed

- **Clearer `vibe lint --redaction` verdict** — `redaction lint passed/FAILED: N critical,
  M warning(s) (<scope>)`.
- **Clearer `vibe context build` budget hint** — names the current budget and suggests `--max-chars`
  when trimming.
- **`vibe context check`** score line reports the advisory-miss count.
- **`vibe decisions` help** clarifies the local-draft / human-review / no-auto-stage boundary.
- **README** reflects the current v0.3.1 workflow (promoted filename convention, `--from-run`
  mapping, placeholder-rejecting `promote`).

### Safety

- Generated `.council/` artifacts (reviews, drafts, context packs, Claude Code exports, operator
  status) remain **gitignored** / local by default; none are committed.
- Redaction lint remains **0 critical**; `decisions lint` passes.
- Promotion into `docs/decisions/` remains **human-reviewed**; nothing auto-commits.
- **License/provenance remains an unresolved commercial "Question 0"** — no commercial-clearance
  claim, no `LICENSE` added.

### Deferred

- MCP read-only export · rolling summaries · a token-aware (real tokenizer) budget ·
  vector/hybrid retrieval · LLM-based context eval · operator event log / notifications ·
  dashboard / mobile / custom remote transport · hosted/team/sync layer.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-30

**Local-first decision memory + curated project context.** Builds the v0.3 decision-memory /
context-pack loop on top of v0.2's multi-provider core. Everything is **deterministic and
local-first** — no LLM summarization, no vector retrieval, no MCP, no hosted/sync. Raw `.council/`
outputs and generated packs/exports stay gitignored; public `docs/decisions/*.md` remain the curated
source of truth.

### Added

- **`vibe lint --redaction`** — a stdlib-only redaction guard for public docs (API keys, private
  keys, secret assignments, per-user local paths, dated `.council/` artifact paths, `.obsidian/`
  workspace), with `--strict` and masked output.
- **Curated decision CLI** over `docs/decisions/*.md`: `vibe decisions list` (with `--tag`/`--status`),
  `show` (path-traversal guarded), `new` (template), and `lint` (frontmatter, stable headings,
  duplicate ids, broken links, redaction).
- **`vibe decisions new --from-run`** — extract a **local** draft decision from a raw council/review
  output (deterministic heuristics, no LLM) into gitignored `.council/decisions/drafts/`.
- **`vibe decisions promote`** — safely promote a human-reviewed draft into `docs/decisions/`
  (validates frontmatter/headings/redaction; sanitized filename; `--dry-run`/`--force`).
- **`vibe context build`** — deterministic context-pack builder from curated decisions + `STATUS.md`
  with a character budget; writes gitignored `.council/context/pack-latest.md`.
- **`vibe context check`** — deterministic context-quality harness (not an LLM eval): required
  sections/constraints + advisory facts/signals + redaction, scored `passed/total`.
- **`vibe context export claude-code`** — wrap the pack as a Claude Code-friendly local context file
  (gitignored; gated on check + redaction; never modifies `CLAUDE.md`).
- **Operator status** — `vibe operator status` / `set` / `clear` over a gitignored
  `.council/operator/status.json` (state/message/next_action/severity).
- **License/provenance checklist** — an engineer's "Question 0" commercial gate
  (`docs/plans/license-and-provenance-resolution.md`), with no commercial-clearance claim and no
  `LICENSE` added.

### Changed

- **README** now documents the end-to-end decision-memory / context workflow.
- **Project status and agent brief** reflect the v0.3 workflow.
- Added `docs/redaction-policy.md` defining what must/should/may be redacted.

### Safety

- Generated `.council/` artifacts (reviews, decisions, drafts, context packs, Claude Code exports,
  operator status) remain **gitignored** / local by default.
- The redaction guard runs across the decision and context workflows (and blocks unsafe context
  build/export).
- Promotion into `docs/decisions/` remains **human-reviewed**; nothing auto-commits.
- **License/provenance remains an unresolved commercial gate** — no commercial-clearance claim.

### Deferred

- MCP read-only export · rolling summaries · a token-aware (real tokenizer) budget ·
  vector/hybrid retrieval · skill/council packs · hosted/team/sync layer ·
  dashboard / mobile / custom remote transport · LLM-based context eval.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-29

The **multi-provider** release: break the single-provider lock-in with a provider
abstraction, add a local **Ollama** provider, and ship `vibe doctor` diagnostics — all
while OpenRouter remains the default and existing behavior is unchanged.

### Added

- **Provider abstraction** — a minimal `Provider` seam with `ChatRequest` / `ChatResult`
  and an **OpenRouter adapter**; legacy helper functions delegate to it with no behavior
  change for OpenRouter users.
- **Provider selection** via `VIBE_PROVIDER`, defaulting to `openrouter`; unsupported
  values fail clearly before any model call.
- **Local Ollama provider** via `VIBE_PROVIDER=ollama` — non-streaming `/api/chat`,
  requires no API key, loopback-only `OLLAMA_HOST` validation (SSRF-safe), and never
  fabricates a dollar cost.
- **`VIBE_OLLAMA_MODEL`** — map the existing preset's OpenRouter-style model IDs to a
  local Ollama model name you've pulled, without redesigning presets.
- **`vibe doctor`** — provider diagnostics (key presence/placeholder, OpenRouter
  model-list reachability, Ollama host validation + `/api/tags` reachability + local model
  list + `VIBE_OLLAMA_MODEL` availability). Runs **no inference** and spends no tokens;
  supports `--offline`.
- **Provider-aware usage/cost messaging** — `--usage` and `--max-cost` now name the active
  provider and state honestly when a provider does not report cost.

### Fixed

- **`full` mode** no longer crashes when a ranking model returns `None` or empty content
  (`parse_ranking_from_text` tolerates missing/empty/whitespace/unparsable output).

### Removed

- **Unused upstream web UI subsystem** — the legacy React + Vite `frontend/`, the
  `backend/main.py` FastAPI server and `backend/storage.py` conversation storage, plus the
  related upstream `start.sh`, root `main.py`, and root `header.jpg` — and the now-unused
  **FastAPI/Uvicorn** dependencies. The product is the local-first CLI; a future app/TUI/web
  surface should be rebuilt intentionally rather than carried over from upstream.

### Changed

- **Project identity** metadata renamed from `llm-council` to `vibe-council`
  (`pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `CLAUDE.md`).
- **Author identity** normalized with a `.mailmap` (display-only; no history rewrite).

### Known limitations

- **Ollama users should set `VIBE_OLLAMA_MODEL`** — presets still carry OpenRouter-style
  model IDs; provider-specific preset config is future work.
- **Local Ollama does not report billing cost**, so `--max-cost` cannot be enforced for
  Ollama runs (cost is never fabricated).
- **MCP, personas/advisors, app/TUI, and community** features are still future work.
- **License/provenance cleanup is ongoing** — parts of the backend still descend from the
  unlicensed upstream `karpathy/llm-council`; no `LICENSE` is added yet.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-28

First public release. Because this is the initial cut, the notes below are a
**feature inventory** of what the fork adds on top of upstream
[`karpathy/llm-council`](https://github.com/karpathy/llm-council) (the council concept:
query several models, peer-review/rank, chairman synthesis), not a since-last-tag delta.

### Added

- **Workflow modes** — `extract`, `mini` (default), `review`, and `full`. `full` is the
  only mode that uses anonymized peer ranking; `review` is the everyday plan/diff gate.
- **Presets** — `cheap`, `balanced` (default), and `premium`, each mapping council /
  chairman / extract roles to OpenRouter model IDs (env-overridable).
- **CLI** — run any mode via `python -m backend.cli`, plus a global **`vibe`** command:
  `--version`, `vibe status`, `vibe review`, `vibe diff`, `vibe extract`, `vibe mini`,
  `vibe full`, `vibe models`, `vibe presets`, `vibe last`, `vibe guide`, `vibe init`,
  `vibe projects`. Output goes to stdout; progress/usage/guard messages to stderr; the
  API key is never printed. Dedicated exit codes (`0`–`7`) for scripts and agents.
- **`.council/` workspace** — a project-local folder (`reviews/`, `diffs/`,
  `decisions/`, `runs/`, `stages/`, `usage/`, `locks/`, `config.json`) created when
  `vibe` runs inside a project, and auto-added to that project's `.gitignore`.
- **Decision memory** — `vibe extract --save` writes a structured decision as JSON +
  Markdown and appends to `.council/decisions/index.jsonl`; `vibe decisions list`,
  `search`, and `context` read it back. These commands call **no model** and need
  **no API key**. Search is plain local string matching (no embeddings/SQLite).
- **Guardrails** — premium guard (`--allow-premium`), pre-run token guard
  (`--max-tokens`, hard block before any call), best-effort cost guard (`--max-cost`),
  a loop guard against duplicate/concurrent/too-frequent runs (`--allow-repeat`,
  `--no-loop-guard`), `--usage` (provider-reported tokens/cost), and `--save-stages`.
- **First-run key guard** — a clear message and exit code **7** when
  `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is missing for a model command, instead of a raw traceback.
- **Tests & CI** — stdlib `unittest` smoke and structural tests, run by GitHub Actions
  on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows.
- **Cross-platform install** — `scripts/install-vibe.ps1` (Windows) and
  `scripts/install-vibe.sh` (macOS/Linux), with `vibe.ps1` / `vibe.cmd` / `vibe.sh`
  launchers that prefer the repo `.venv` and never print the key.
- **Examples & docs** — `examples/` (sample plans + workflow walkthroughs, readable
  without spending credits), [`docs/agent-integrations.md`](docs/agent-integrations.md),
  and committed plan docs under `docs/plans/`.
- **Demo guide & transcript** — [`docs/demo.md`](docs/demo.md) (safe terminal-recording
  guide) plus a committed, sanitized text walkthrough at
  [`docs/demo-transcript.md`](docs/demo-transcript.md).
- **Privacy / local-first docs** — explicit explanation that artifacts stay local while
  your prompts/files/diffs **are** sent to OpenRouter (not local inference), plus
  bring-your-own-key / cost transparency.
- **Web UI** — the original React + Vite council UI (stage tabs) still runs against the
  FastAPI backend.

### Known limitations

- **OpenRouter-only** — bring-your-own-key; no provider abstraction yet.
- **No Ollama / local inference** — prompts are sent to remote providers.
- **No MCP server** yet.
- **No real demo recording yet** — a sanitized text transcript
  ([`docs/demo-transcript.md`](docs/demo-transcript.md)) ships; an actual asciinema
  cast / GIF remains an approved follow-up.
- **Decision search is plain string matching** — no embeddings or SQLite.
